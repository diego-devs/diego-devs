### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**diego-devs/diego-devs** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently looking for job!  
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning fullstack developer bootcamp at Microsoft Launch X
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Object Oriented Programming projects. 

- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about .NET, C#, Javascript and music.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm also a musician ğŸ¤˜
